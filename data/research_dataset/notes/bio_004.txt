Evolution Study Guide

Natural Selection: process where organisms better adapted to environment survive and reproduce. Proposed by Charles Darwin.

Key principles:
1. Variation exists in populations
2. Some variations are heritable
3. More offspring produced than can survive
4. Organisms with advantageous traits more likely to survive

Adaptation: trait that increases fitness in a particular environment.

Speciation is the formation of new species. Occurs when populations become reproductively isolated.

Fossil record provides evidence for evolution - shows changes in organisms over time.

Homologous structures: similar structures in different species due to common ancestry. Example - human arm and whale flipper.
