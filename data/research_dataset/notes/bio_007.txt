Ecosystems and Food Chains

An ecosystem is a community of living organisms interacting with their physical environment.

A food chain is a linear sequence showing how energy passes from one organism to another.

Producers are organisms that make their own food through photosynthesis. Also called autotrophs.

A consumer is an organism that obtains energy by eating other organisms.

Decomposers are organisms that break down dead organic matter and return nutrients to the soil.

Biodiversity is the variety of life forms within a given ecosystem or on Earth.

A habitat is the natural environment where an organism lives and meets its basic needs.

The food web is a complex network of interconnected food chains in an ecosystem.
