Narrative Structure

The plot is the sequence of events in a story, typically following a structured arc.

Exposition: the introduction of background information, characters, and setting at the start.

Rising action is the series of events that build tension and lead toward the climax.

The climax is the point of highest tension in a story. The turning point of the narrative.

Falling action: the events that occur after the climax, leading toward the resolution.

The resolution is the final outcome of the story where conflicts are resolved.

Foreshadowing is a technique where the author hints at future events in the story.
