Matrices and Linear Algebra

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers arranged in rows and columns.

A vector is a mathematical object with both magnitude and direction, represented as an ordered list.

The determinant is a scalar value calculated from a matrix that describes certain properties.

An eigenvalue is a scalar that indicates how much a linear transformation stretches a vector.

Linear independence means no vector in a set can be written as a combination of the others.

The transpose is a matrix formed by swapping the rows and columns of the original matrix.

Scalar multiplication is the operation of multiplying every element of a matrix by a single number.
