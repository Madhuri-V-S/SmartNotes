Evolution and Natural Selection

Evolution is the gradual change in inherited characteristics of biological populations over successive generations.

Natural selection is the process where organisms better adapted to their environment survive and reproduce more.

Adaptation is a trait that increases an organism's fitness and survival in its environment.

A species is a group of organisms that share common characteristics and can interbreed.

Extinction is the permanent disappearance of a species when all members have died.

Fossils are preserved remains of ancient organisms that provide evidence for evolution.

Variation is the differences in traits among individuals of the same species.
