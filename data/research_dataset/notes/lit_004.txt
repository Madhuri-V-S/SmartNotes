Shakespeare and Drama

A tragedy is a dramatic work ending in the downfall or death of the main character.

The soliloquy is a speech where a character speaks their thoughts aloud, alone on stage.

Comic relief: humorous scenes inserted into a serious work to provide emotional release.

A foil is a character whose contrasting traits highlight the qualities of another character.

Dramatic irony is when the audience knows something that the characters do not.

The aside is a remark made by an actor to the audience, unheard by other characters.

Catharsis: the emotional release experienced by the audience at the end of a tragedy.
