Statistics and Probability

Statistics is the branch of mathematics dealing with collection, analysis, and interpretation of data.

The mean is the average of a dataset, calculated by dividing the sum of values by the count.

Median: the middle value in an ordered dataset. Splits data into two equal halves.

The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset.

Standard deviation is a measure of how spread out values are from the mean.

Probability: the likelihood of an event occurring, expressed as a value between 0 and 1.

A sample is a subset of a population used to draw conclusions about the whole group.

Variance: the average of squared differences from the mean. Measures data spread.
