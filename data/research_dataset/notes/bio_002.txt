Photosynthesis

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose.

The overall equation for photosynthesis is given by:
6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy → C6H12O6 + 6O2

Chloroplasts: organelles where photosynthesis occurs in plant cells. Contains chlorophyll pigment.

Light-dependent reactions occur in the thylakoid membranes. They produce ATP and NADPH using light energy.

Calvin Cycle: also known as light-independent reactions or dark reactions. Takes place in the stroma of chloroplasts. Uses ATP and NADPH to fix CO2 into glucose.

Stomata are pores on leaf surfaces that regulate gas exchange, allowing CO2 in and O2 out.
