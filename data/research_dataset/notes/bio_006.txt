Genetics and DNA

DNA is a double-helix molecule that carries the genetic instructions for all living organisms.

A gene is a segment of DNA that encodes the instructions for building a specific protein.

Chromosomes are thread-like structures made of DNA and proteins found in cell nuclei.

The genome is the complete set of genetic material in an organism.

Mutation: a permanent change in the DNA sequence of an organism. Can be harmful or beneficial.

A dominant trait is a genetic characteristic that appears when at least one copy of the gene is present.

Recessive traits are characteristics that only appear when two copies of the gene are inherited.

Heredity is the passing of genetic traits from parents to offspring.
