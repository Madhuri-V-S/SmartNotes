Ecology and Ecosystems

Ecology: the study of interactions between organisms and their environment.

Population: group of individuals of the same species living in the same area.

Community: all populations of different species living together in an area.

Ecosystem: includes community plus all abiotic factors (non-living components) like water, soil, sunlight.

Biome: large geographic region characterized by specific climate and organisms. Examples - tundra, desert, rainforest.

Food Chain: linear sequence showing energy transfer - producers → primary consumers → secondary consumers.

Producers are autotrophs that make their own food through photosynthesis.

Consumers: heterotrophs that obtain energy by eating other organisms.

Decomposers: organisms that break down dead organic matter. Include bacteria and fungi.
