Geometry: Triangles

A triangle is a polygon with three sides and three angles that sum to 180 degrees.

The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right triangle, a² + b² = c², where c is the hypotenuse.

The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle, opposite the right angle.

Area: the amount of space inside a two-dimensional shape. For triangles, Area = (1/2) × base × height.

An acute triangle is a triangle where all three angles are less than 90 degrees.

The perimeter is the total distance around the outside of a shape.

Congruent triangles are triangles that are identical in shape and size.

Similarity: two triangles are similar if their angles are equal and sides are proportional.
