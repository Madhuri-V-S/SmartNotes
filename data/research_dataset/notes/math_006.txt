Functions and Graphs

A function is a relationship where each input value maps to exactly one output value.

The domain is the set of all possible input values for a function.

The range is the set of all possible output values produced by a function.

A linear function is a function whose graph forms a straight line with constant rate of change.

An asymptote is a line that a graph approaches but never touches or crosses.

Inverse functions are two functions that undo each other when composed together.

The y-intercept is the point where a graph crosses the vertical axis, found when x equals zero.
