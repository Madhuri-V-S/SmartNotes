Calculus: Derivatives

A derivative is the rate of change of a function at any given point. Represents instantaneous rate of change.

The limit is the value a function approaches as the input approaches a certain value.

Differentiation: the process of finding the derivative of a function.

The chain rule is a formula for computing the derivative of a composite function.

A critical point is a point where the derivative equals zero or is undefined.

Integration is the reverse process of differentiation. Used to find area under a curve.

The integral is the result of integration, representing accumulated change over an interval.

A continuous function is a function with no breaks, gaps, or jumps in its graph.
