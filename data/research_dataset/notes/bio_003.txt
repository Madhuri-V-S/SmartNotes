DNA and Genetics - Lecture Notes

DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid): the hereditary material in organisms. Contains genetic instructions.

Structure - DNA is a double helix structure discovered by Watson and Crick in 1953.

Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA. Each has three parts:
- Phosphate group
- Deoxyribose sugar  
- Nitrogenous base (A, T, G, or C)

Base pairing rules: Adenine pairs with Thymine (A-T), Guanine pairs with Cytosine (G-C). These are held together by hydrogen bonds.

Genes are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins.

Chromosomes: structures made of DNA and proteins. Humans have 23 pairs.
