Plant Biology

Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into glucose and oxygen.

Chlorophyll is the green pigment in plants responsible for absorbing light energy for photosynthesis.

The root system is the underground part of a plant that absorbs water and nutrients from soil.

Transpiration is the process by which plants release water vapor through their leaves.

A seed is a fertilized ovule containing an embryo and stored nutrients for germination.

Pollination is the transfer of pollen from the male part to the female part of a flower.

Osmosis is the movement of water through a semipermeable membrane from high to low concentration.
