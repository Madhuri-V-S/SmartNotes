Cell Structure and Function

Prokaryotic Cells: cells that lack a membrane-bound nucleus and other organelles. Examples include bacteria and archaea.

Eukaryotic Cells: cells with a true nucleus enclosed by a membrane. Found in animals, plants, fungi, and protists.

The plasma membrane is a selectively permeable barrier composed of phospholipid bilayer. It regulates what enters and exits the cell.

Mitochondria: known as the powerhouse of the cell, responsible for ATP production through cellular respiration.

Ribosomes are molecular machines that synthesize proteins by translating mRNA.

Endoplasmic Reticulum: network of membranes involved in protein and lipid synthesis. Two types exist - rough ER (with ribosomes) and smooth ER (without ribosomes).
