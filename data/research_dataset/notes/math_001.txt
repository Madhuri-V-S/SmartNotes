Linear Equations (Algebra)

A linear equation is a mathematical statement that two expressions are equal, containing variables raised to the first power.

The slope-intercept form is written as y = mx + b, where m represents the slope and b represents the y-intercept.

Slope: the rate of change between two points on a line. Calculated as rise over run.

The x-intercept is the point where a line crosses the x-axis. Found by setting y = 0.

Variables: symbols that represent unknown quantities in an equation.

A coefficient is a number multiplied by a variable in an algebraic expression.

The solution is the value of the variable that makes the equation true.
