Quadratic Equations

A quadratic equation is a polynomial equation of degree 2, written in the form ax² + bx + c = 0.

The quadratic formula is x = (-b ± √(b²-4ac)) / 2a. Used to find roots of any quadratic.

The discriminant is the expression b²-4ac. Determines the number and type of solutions.

Roots: the values of x that satisfy the quadratic equation. Also called solutions or zeros.

A parabola is the U-shaped curve formed by graphing a quadratic function.

The vertex is the highest or lowest point of a parabola. Represents the maximum or minimum value.

Factoring: rewriting a quadratic as a product of two binomials to find its roots.
