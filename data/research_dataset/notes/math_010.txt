Set Theory and Logic

A set is a collection of distinct objects considered as a single entity.

The union of two sets is the set containing all elements from both sets combined.

The intersection is the set containing only elements that appear in both sets simultaneously.

A subset is a set whose elements are all contained within another larger set.

Complement is the set of all elements not contained in a given set within the universal set.

A proposition is a statement that is either true or false but not both.

Logical implication is a conditional statement where one proposition follows from another.
